# Music generator #

This is a hobby project that aims to generate simple tunes programatically using Javascript.

This project uses [MIDI.js](http://mudcu.be/midi-js/) to generate the sounds, [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com/) for the SVG graphics to draw the piano, and I'm using [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) to compile the css.

I've basically been writing javascript to model the structure necessary to produce a melody.
My hope is that this thing will some day be able to generate randomized simple melodies that sound reasonably appealing.

I'm using this as a means to learn more about music theory, and to explore what it means to produce music. It's been quite entertaining.

Music is so basic, universal, and yet transcendent. It has a way of reaching into you humanity and manipulating your mind and appendages.
There are magical forumlas that makes it tick, yet the most interesting music exploits your expectations, decieves, then passifies, lifts, then falls.
It skirts the borders of comfort by finding an interesting mix of structure and chaos.
It can take you on an emotional rollercoaster if you find yourself immersed in it. It's both complex yet simple.
I've been developing this sense of reverence for music for a while. This project is a way of cultivating that appreciation.

I'm interested to crack the code, to see how it operates. I want to discover the patterns. I want to break it down and witness it's components on all scales.
I wan't to break pop music. I want to generate formulaic pop songs that sound ok, then see what I can do to break the formula in various way, then find out if it makes it more interesting.
